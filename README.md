# Ant Colony Optimisation

Ant Colony Optimisation is a solution to the traveling salesman problem (TSP). TSP is a problem where a path needs to be found between different waypoints. This may sound easy to do, but without any optimisations, finding the shortest path possible has a complexity of O(n!). This means that for just 20 waypoints, it may already take a few hundred years to find the optimal solution.

Ant Colony Optimisation shortens the calculation time by a lot, however, it does not garantee the shortest possible path will be returned. It does this in iterations. Each iteration, a few virtual ants get set loose on the graph. They try to find a semi-random path, by always choosing the next node based on distance and pheremones left by previous ants. After the ants have found their path, they leave an amount of pheremones inversely proportional to the length of the path. After a predefined number of iterations, the path calculated will be very short for the amount of time it took to calculate.
